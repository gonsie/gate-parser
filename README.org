* Parser for Gate Project
  This project contains ply-based parsers for [[http://www.opensourceliberty.org/opensourceliberty.html][Liberty]] gate libraries and Verilog netlists. Note that these are not tested. They may only work for a subset of general grammars.
  
** Dependencies

   [[https://github.com/dabeaz/ply][Python Lex-Yacc by dabeaz]]

** Running
   The parsers can be run from `production.sh`. The scripts generate code in the `current` directory.

** Todo
   - gate functions should take input, output, and current_state vectors
   - ablity to print stats for gates/library

** Branches
  - Master: this represents the branch currently integrated with the [[https://github.com/gonsie/gates][ROSS/gates]] project
  - sql: utilizes an SQL database to store the object model
  - py_classes: utilizes python classes to store the object model
